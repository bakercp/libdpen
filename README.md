libdpen
=======

A library for reading .ELI, .WPI and other files generated by digital pens such as Wacom's Inkling, IntelliPens, and others.

This spec was reverse-engineered from the WPI files made by my Inkling device.

My understanding of the spec is here:

https://github.com/bakercp/libdpen/blob/master/docs/ELI_FileSpec.md

This library allows an alternative to commercial readers such as Wacom's Sketch Manager http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Inkling/Sketch-Manager.aspx and , Intellipen's Pen & Ink Editor http://www.intellipens.com/?CategoryID=160, etc.
